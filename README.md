# microservices-templates
What a cool project name, eh?
---
Well, in this project I'll put in practice my –short– knowledge about [microservices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microservices) and some programming languages.  

My idea is coding microservices templates and examples in different programming languages, here's my initial wish list:

0. Node using JavaScript [(work in progress)](./00-node)
1. Node using TypeScript
2. C# using dotnetcore
3. Python
4. Go


I'm open to suggestions so you can contact me [here](./issues), by twitter ([@jersson](https://twitter/jersson)) or the [contact form on my blog](https://jersson.net/contact/).
