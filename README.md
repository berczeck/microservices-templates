# microservices-templates
What a cool project name, eh?
---
Well, in this project I'll put in practice my –short– knowledge in [microservices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microservices) and some programming languages.  

I'm open to suggestions so you can contact me here, by twitter ([@jersson](https://twitter/jersson)) or the [contact form on my blog](https://jersson.net/contact/)
