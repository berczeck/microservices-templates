# node-microservices
The main goal here is coding microservices [template](./00-template) and examples using Node and TypeScript
---

**Examples**

0. [List all books using HTTP GET](./00-get)
1. Show book information using HTTP GET
2. Buy some books using HTTP POST 
3. List all books (deployed on a Docker container)
4. List all books and handling errors
5. List all books (includes unit testing)

All the examples are based on this [template](./00-template). You can also use it :)
