Using HTTP GET (without parameters)
---
The main goal here is coding a microservices example using Node and JavaScript

**How to test the service** </br>

Run this command in the console:
```
npm test
```

If everything is okay, you'll see something like this message:
```
Test Suites: 1 passed, 1 total
Tests:       1 passed, 1 total
Snapshots:   0 total
Time:        1.465s
Ran all test suites.
````

**Notes** </br>
You can also use run the service and test it using this url :)

```
curl http://localhost:3000/books
```

The test file is under the test folder, we are using [Jest](https://jestjs.io/en/) :)
